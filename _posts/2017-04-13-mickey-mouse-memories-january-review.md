I remember waking up and checking my email, like I do every morning, to find an email from shopDisney about this new Mickey Mouse line to celebrate his 90th birthday. The design was cool, especially with the first month playing off the Steamboat Willie theme, but I really hate paying for shipping. Plus, the email said this was a "limited release," but really, this is Disney; they're going to make thousands of these things because they'll sell. Just how "limited" could it be?

Fast forward a week, and I get another email from shopDisney. This time I can receive free shipping on any purchase. Fine. What the hell. I'll buy the plush and mug. (I'm a sucker for mugs. They somehow came to be the thing I collect in all my travels. I have no idea why or how, but it is what it is, so ya...)

I hop on the shopDisney app but soon find that the plush is sold out. Wow, he really was limited, I guess. So I ordered the mug.

I called my closest Disney Store to see if they had any of the plush left. They told me he sold out in a matter of days, and confirmed that, once stock was gone, it was gone. Now I was intrigued.

I knew I'd have to resort to eBay, and I'm glad I did when I did. I bought him on eBay a week after release... for over twice the retail amount, plus shipping. Say what you will, but I wanted to at least have this one.

In fact, I'm lucky to have bought him when I did. Had I waited another week, his price double again. I mean, you can find him selling for over $200 on eBay now. That's insane!

So what made me – and so many others – fall in love with this plush so much? Let's take a closer look.

Steamboat Willie was Walt Disney's first cartoon with synchronized sound. It was also the first real debut of Mickey Mouse. Walt's innovation began to shine, eventually leading his company into the powerhouse it is today.

And no other company like Disney would put so much care into such a small package. Their attention to detail on this plush is phenomenal. From the embroidered Mickeys that capture that first image from Steamboat Willie, to the material he's comprised of, this isn't your average Mickey plush.

His entire body is made of a leather-like vinyl, giving him a smooth and polished look and feel. The stitching throughout is amazing, but you can especially tell its high-quality by looking at it around his eyes.

This isn't the first Mickey plush I've purchased in recent years, but this is the first one where I realized how intricate the mold of his mouth is. You get that classic Mickey smile, with the added depth of his tongue.

I didn't immediately notice, but others have pointed out how he also doesn't have his traditional gloves, much like he didn't in Steamboat Willie.

On his left foot, he also has the official Mickey Mouse Memories seal, which lets you know that this is Series 1 of 12.

On his right, you have one of Walt Disney's infamous quotes: I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse.

As for the mug, they've made each of these to be stackable. I can only hope that they release some sort of stand by the end of the year, because that would help hold them all in place and round them out into an excellent display piece.

They've either made more mugs available or the mugs aren't as popular because they'd stayed in stock the longest.

The color design matches that of the plush: silver on black with white accents. Remember that stitched Mickey on the plush? The same design is imprinted around the rim. Again, the level of detail is amazing.

Finally, on the inside rim, the Walt Disney quote is present again.

The mug retails for $18.95 US, $24.95 CAN, £12.50 and €15.00.

And the plush goes for $24.95 US, $31.95 CAN, £25.00 and €38.00.
